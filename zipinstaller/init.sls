# Description:
# This is a 32-bit zip archive program installer that installes directly from zip archives and creates shortcuts and un-install entries
# automatically, exactly as defined in a simple '~zipinst~.zic' if it finds it inside the zip archive.
#
# All it takes is calling up 'zipinst.exe /i <archive>.zip' that contains a file called '~zipinst~.zic', which itself is in *.ini file
# format and contains, directives about where it should install etc.
#
# Source:
# http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/zipinst.html
# http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/zipinst.exe
# http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/zipinst.zip (need to add '~zipinst~.zic' to it)
# you have to insert the '~zipinst~.zic' file into the 'zipinst.zip' file
# and place the resulting zipinst.zip into the 'salt://win/repo-ng/zipinstaller/' on your master
# as well as the 'zipinst.exe' and 'cache_dir: True' will copy all files from master to minion cache
